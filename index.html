      <p>From the moment a child is big enough to hold a crayon and put it to paper, drawing is a great way to communicate and understand what they are thinking. Interpreting children's drawings becomes easier as they get older, and you can learn a surprising amount from what they create. Understanding their drawings at every stage of their development is a great tool for parents.</p>
      <p>Everyone hopes to find meaning in a childâ€™s drawings. Sometimes drawings are just drawings, with nothing more than a fun playtime showing itself on the page. But sometimes, interpreting kids' drawings means that you discover a deeper layer to what they are thinking and feeling. It is very important not to read too much into a drawing, but instead to allow the child to tell you what the drawing means to them. Asking questions, such as what the people in the drawing are doing, can reveal things from your child that you might never see yourself.</p>
